I apologize for the confusion in the previous explanation. Let's correct the design for the PWM control circuit with a pull-up resistor and a diode for proper operation, and I'll also provide a more accurate ASCII schematic representation.

### **Corrected Circuit Description:**

In this corrected design, the PWM signal from the Arduino Uno controls the EN (enable) pin of the LM2596 buck converter. A pull-up resistor is used to keep the EN pin high (enabled) when the PWM signal is not actively pulling it low. The diode is used to prevent the pull-up voltage from feeding back into the PWM pin on the Arduino, allowing the PWM signal to control the LM2596 without interference.

### **Components Needed:**
- Arduino Uno
- LM2596 Buck Converter Module
- Resistors (e.g., 10kΩ for pull-up, 10kΩ for voltage dividers)
- Diode (e.g., 1N4148 or similar small signal diode)
- Voltage Divider Resistors
- Connecting Wires

### **Circuit Operation:**
- **Voltage Sensing:**
  - The car battery voltage and the LM2596 output voltage are measured using voltage dividers and fed to the analog input pins of the Arduino for monitoring and control.
  
- **PWM Control:**
  - The Arduino generates a PWM signal that controls the EN pin of the LM2596 through a diode and a pull-up resistor. The pull-up resistor keeps the EN pin high by default, enabling the LM2596.
  - The diode allows the PWM signal to pull the EN pin low, disabling the LM2596 when the PWM is low.

### **Corrected ASCII Art Schematic:**

Here’s the corrected ASCII art schematic:

### **Component Explanation:**

1. **Voltage Divider (R1, R2):**
   - Reduces the car battery voltage to a range that the Arduino can safely measure (0-5V).
   - **R1** and **R2** are chosen to ensure the divided voltage stays within the ADC input range of the Arduino.

2. **Voltage Divider (R3, R4):**
   - Reduces the output voltage of the LM2596 to a measurable range for the Arduino.
   - The Arduino reads this voltage and compares it to the desired output voltage.

3. **PWM Control Circuit with Pull-Up (R6, D1):**
   - **R6** is a pull-up resistor (e.g., 10kΩ) connected between the EN pin of the LM2596 and the supply voltage (either +5V from the Arduino or Vin of the LM2596). It ensures that the EN pin is pulled high (enabled) when the PWM signal is not pulling it low.
   - **D1** (1N4148 or similar) is a small signal diode that isolates the Arduino's PWM pin from the pull-up voltage. It allows the PWM signal to pull the EN pin low when the PWM is low, effectively disabling the LM2596.
   - The diode's cathode (marked end) is connected to the EN pin, while the anode is connected to the Arduino's PWM pin. This arrangement ensures that the EN pin can only be pulled low by the PWM signal and not high through the PWM pin.

4. **LM2596 Buck Converter:**
   - The LM2596 is a step-down (buck) voltage regulator that reduces the car battery voltage to a lower, stable voltage suitable for charging or powering a lithium-ion battery or other loads.
   - The EN pin controls the output of the LM2596. By modulating this pin with the PWM signal, the output voltage can be adjusted dynamically.
   - LM2596 usually comes as ready DC-DC assembled board. Set the output voltage to 4.25V so 100% PWM will be recognized as 100% charge and there is no risk of damaging the dongle

### **Working Principle:**
- The Arduino reads the car battery voltage and the output voltage of the LM2596 via the voltage dividers.
- The Arduino then calculates the appropriate PWM duty cycle needed to regulate the output voltage to match the desired lithium-ion battery voltage.
- The PWM signal is sent through **D1** to the EN pin of the LM2596. When the PWM signal is low, the EN pin is pulled low through the diode, disabling the LM2596 and reducing the output voltage.
- When the PWM signal is high, the diode blocks the pull-up voltage from the PWM pin, allowing the pull-up resistor **R6** to keep the EN pin high, enabling the LM2596 and maintaining or increasing the output voltage.
- This setup allows the Arduino to control the LM2596's output voltage by varying the PWM duty cycle, enabling dynamic and precise voltage regulation.

This corrected design provides a reliable and effective method for using an Arduino to control the LM2596 output voltage with proper protection and stability.
